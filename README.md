# Swarm Population-Based Training With Particle Swarm Optimization Learning (SBT-PSO) [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)

Code for the Swarm Population-Based Training With Particle Swarm Optimization Learning (SBT-PSO) algorithm, from the paper *Swarm-Based Training for Online Hyperparameter Optimization*.

The SBT framework is implemented based on [ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/getting-started.html). Heavily inspired by ray tune PBT example and GPBT-PL implementation.


### Running the code

To run the PPO experiment, use command:

    python run_ppo_v1.py
